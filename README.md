# Hospitality-end-to-end-data-analytics-project
This project focuses on an end-to-end data analytics solution for AtliQ Grands, a luxury and business hotel chain facing revenue and market share challenges. By analyzing   historical data, an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide actionable insights into revenue, occupancy rates, customer preferences, and operational  performance.
## Project Objective
- Analyze historical revenue data to identify patterns, trends, and factors affecting revenue    performance.
- Provide actionable insights to maximize revenue streams across different properties, cities, and customer segments.
- Understand customer booking patterns, preferences, and spending habits.
- Analyze the performance of different room types (e.g., deluxe, suite, premium) and booking platforms (e.g., direct booking, third-party platforms).
- Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize insights effectively.
- Ensure reports are user-friendly for non-technical stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions.

•	Ensure data accuracy and integrity.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.
•	Use descriptive and diagnostic analytics to understand past performance.
•	Define and calculate KPIs like Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Occupancy %, etc.
•	Design interactive Power BI dashboards to present insights.
•	Include visualizations for revenue trends, occupancy by city, category-wise revenue, and booking platform performance.
